        <h3 class="answer-header">Be present</h3>
        <p class="subhead">Attendance</p>
        <p>Triton College has designated this course as an Extended Remote Learning class (ERL). The class will meet synchronously. This means students MUST be present for each class period. This is a LIVE, web-based synchronous course. Let it be understood that students in this course who miss more than 2 class period sessions will be automatically withdrawn from the class up to the college’s official withdrawal date. Students may be absent for any reason “necessary, including  illnesses, personal reasons, death in the family” etc. The instructor will not judge whether one person’s reason for absence is more valid than another person’s reason. </p>
        <h3 class="answer-header">Be on time</h3>
        <p>Students <b>must</b> submit <em>all major</em> essays by 11:59:00 on the due date. If the essay is submitted after 11:59:00, the paper is considered late. Each paper should be submitted via Blackboard. <span class="highlight">Please DO NOT send any essays by email.</span> If you need help, please ask. <strong>Students must receive at least a D on the multi-sourced research analysis/argument essay in order to be eligible to pass the course.</strong></p>
        <p class="subhead">Tardiness</p>
        <p> Because this class meets LIVE, punctuality is required. Tardies will accrue at the rate of 2 tardies=1 absence. Keep in mind that these absences work into your total from the section above. Remember as well that on the days where there are time-sensitive in-class assignments, there will not be extra time to make up missed work. Upon the 5th accrued tardy students will be withdrawn from the class. Any log-ins 10 minutes late or more will be considered absent. Leaving class or logging out before dismissal will be counted as tardy. Please show respect by being on time.</p>
        <h3 class="answer-header">Write</h3>

        <p class="subhead">Plagiarism</p>
        <p>Plagiarism refers to copying what someone else has written or taking someone else’s ideas and passing them off as your own. Plagiarism also includes recycling papers the student has written for a previous class. Plagiarism is NOT TOLERATED at Triton College whether intentionally or inadvertently.

        <p class="subhead">Academic Honesty statement</p>
        <p class="italic">“Triton College closely adheres to principles of academic honesty and integrity. The Academic Honesty Policy is designed to inform students and faculty of the expectations and procedures associated with the honest pursuit of a Triton College education. Overall, academic achievement is a product of personal commitment, the investigation of knowledge, and a pursuit of independent and honest work, both in and out of the classroom. All forms of cheating deprive the student of achieving true academic success and are therefore considered serious violations. Furthermore, all incidents of cheating will result in a disciplinary response from college officials. The policy is outlined in the student handbook”.</p>
